# un-woke
Detect woke language in your source code  

## Usage
```
go build
mv woke un-woke

# From file
./un-woke drumpf-bad.js

# From stdin (Why?)
echo pee pee poo poo | ./un-woke --stdin 
```

I honestly don't can't be bothered to replace all the instances of `woke` with `un-woke` because I might break something and the whole project structure is shit so the binary will be called `woke` but you can rename it. D is a cool language, you should probably try it, the project structures are way better.
